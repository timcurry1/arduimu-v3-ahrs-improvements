Introduction

This is the home of a new project to resurrect the ArduIMU V3 for use as a stand alone AHRS by streamlining the existing Arduino IMU/AHRS software.  That code was adopted from Bill Premerlani's Direction Cosine Matrix project and ported to the ArduIMU by Jordi Munoz, Jose Julio, Doug Weibel, and Ahmad Byagowi.  It has since evolved into a full autopilot system and support for the stand alone aspect has substantially fallen by the wayside.

The code for the original ArduIMU V3 can be found here:  http://code.google.com/p/ardu-imu/wiki/HomePage.
